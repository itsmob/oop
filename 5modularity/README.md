Modularity _(Divide and qounquer)_

Modularity is closely related to classes and is a principle of Object Oriented Programming and goes hand in hand with Modular Design which means dividing a system into small parts and these will be our modules and can function independently.

The modularity of our code will allow us:

- Re-use
- Avoid crashes
- Make our code more maintainable
- Readability
- Quick problem resolution

A good practice is to separate the classes into different files
